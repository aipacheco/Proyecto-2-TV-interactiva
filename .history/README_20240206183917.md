# ðŸ“º Interactive TV ðŸ“º

Development of an interactive television interface with a remote control using web technologies  (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). An intuitive and functional user experience that simulates the interaction with a real television.


## Television:

- Design of a home screen that simulates the welcome interface of a television (intro). Note that you have to wait for the intro to end before you can use the tv ðŸ˜‰
- Presentation of relevant information such as channel name and current time

## Remote control:

- Implementation of a virtual remote control using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- Inclusion of buttons to change channels, adjust volume, mute and numbers for every channel available (1 to 9)
- Extra: added a Netflix button that shows the Netflix intro and doesnÂ´t allow you to change the channel up or down.
- Extra 2 : added a feature so that when the volume reaches zero the sound is muted and pressing volume + restarts the volume counter.

## Validations:

Implementation of validations in JavaScript to prevent unwanted actions or incorrect inputs, such as the TV running when the TV is turned off.

## Pending: 
The project is responsive but the screen image does not adjust to the mobile, point to improve in next developments.
